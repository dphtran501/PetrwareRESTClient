# PetrwareRESTClient

REST client for the Petrware e-commerce web application.

Petrware opens up on the home page which shows the list of products available for purchase. 

A navigation bar is at the top of the page with links to the homepage, "About" page, and "Checkout" page. Clicking on either "Petrware" or "Home" will take the user to the home page. Clicking on "About" will take the user to the "About" page. Clicking o the "My Cart" button will take the user to the "Checkout" page.

If a user clicks on a product's image in the homepage, they will be taken to that product's page. There they will find more information about the product, as well as add a specifed quantity of that product to their online shopping cart. Clicking the "Add to Cart" button will take the user to the "Checkout" page.

The "Checkout" page will show the products the user added to their online shopping cart, the running total cost of all items in the shopping cart, and a form to fill to complete the purchasing of items in the list. Filling out the form correctly and clicking the "Submit" button will direct the user to a summary page of the purchase.

The "About" page contains information pertaining to Petrware, their business, their members, and other information.
